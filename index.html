Doge is love, Doge is life,\n
Cate gets near, Doge gets knife.
When Doge is done, cate is kill,
Wow such amaze, Doge is thrill.

Now Doge is lonely, many bad
No more Cate, very sad
Doge says, "Cate, please return"
Silence around Doge, such concern

Doge he learned from his mistake
Did not mean to Cate's life take
So Doge holds back all his fury
Wow such care, Cate Doge bury

Doge digs the grave, with his own paws
He digs, he digs, with legs like saws
Doge he carefully Cate puts in
He forgives the Lord, wow such sin
